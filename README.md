Timer is a free and open-source library dedicated for React Native that makes the process of handling timers easier and much cleaner.
* **Improves code quality.** Start timer using the `useTimer` hook. Stop the timer with `stop()` method. Simple as never.
* **Run your timer in both directions.** Our Timer can operate in both modes (increasing or decreasing).
* **Supports background mode.** Don't worry about the timer when the app goes into the background. We handled it!
* **And much more.** Our library allows you to convert the current time to a string or to display the timer progress in no time.
